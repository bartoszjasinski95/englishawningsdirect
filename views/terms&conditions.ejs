    <h1>Terms and Conditions English Awnings Direct.</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>1. The prices quoted are nett, unless otherwise stated, based on today’s ruling costs. They will remain for 30 days thereafter are subject to variation in relation to increased costs.</p>
    <p>2. Our terms are 50% deposit when placing the order and until such deposit is received, the order will not be processed. 50% is the balance payment and is due on the day of installation or as specifically previously agreed in writing. However, the amount of deposit can vary depending on the project size and value.</p>
    <p>3. A 50% deposit is payable when the order is placed. If the client delays installation, the Company reserves the right to collect a further 40% deposit two months after the date of order and the final 10% is then payable on the day of installation.</p>
    <p>4. Overdue accounts will accrue interest at the rate of 5% per month or part thereof.</p>
    <p>5.  No responsibility is accepted for client’s own measurements or diagrams.</p>
    <p>6. Where local planning permission may be necessary, it is the client’s own responsibility to obtain it. Should planning be refused and the goods have been ordered and made then the full invoice amount will be charged. We can store the goods but a fee may be charged for this whilst any appeals are carried out storage costs start from £50.00 per month.</p>
    <p>7. Our estimate excludes any cutting away, making good or redecoration of the surrounding area/s unless priced in advance.</p>
    <p>8. All our electronic installations are surface mounted. Power points are to be supplied by the client. We test and set limits to tubular motor supplied by us. Any channeling of wiring is to be carried out by the client’s own electrician at their expense. We do not employ qualified electricians and therefore we are unable to undertake any electrical work. We can connect to your external supply and set limits.</p>
    <p>9. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, our work will be fitted during normal working hours from Monday to Friday, proceeding without interruption. Any out of hours work or weekend work will incur additional costs.</p>
    <p>10. We do not accept responsibility for the correct working of our products unless they are fixed by our own skilled installers.</p>
    <p>11. We cannot be held responsible for repairs or replacement parts that are old, damaged or not fitted by the Company and result in errors that become apparent during our installation. Repair work is estimated by the Company and as seen during our site survey. Should further parts or labour be required then we will charge additional for these.</p>
    <p>12. We cannot be held responsible for damage caused to awnings as a result of them being left out in adverse weather conditions, especially strong winds and rain. They are primarily sun blinds and care should be taken to avoid any unnecessary damage.</p>
    <p>13. It is assumed that the surface to which we are requested to fit is sufficient to hold the product. We will not be held responsible for damage caused by inadequate fixing surfaces.</p>
    <p>14. For health and safety precautions, it is the responsibility of the client to advise the Company of the presence of any hazardous substances, e.g. asbestos, that may be on site.</p>
    <p>15. Our installations are guaranteed for 12 months after completion, during which time our faulty parts or workmanship will be rectified (subject to inspection by the Company).</p>
    <p>16. If the client considers the installation/work completed is not in accordance with his/her installations, the client must notify the Company in writing within seven days of installation/work being completed. We would require any such notification to be in writing to the company address or by to the insigniablindsoffice@gmail.com
        . Should no notification be made then the full amount would become due.</p>
    <p>17. Skilled labour and the necessary plant are provided for all installations but where special scaffolding, suspended cradling or hoisting equipment is necessary, this is to be supplied and erected by the client at no cost to the Company, unless otherwise previously agreed in writing. The Company is to have free use of an accessible electric power supply. Should access equipment be made available on installation then it must be provided free of charge and pre-erected for us by the Company for the life of the item being installed by the Company.</p>
    <p>18. Insurance – our legal liabilities to our employees and the general public are insured under an Employer’s and Public Liability insurance policy.</p>
    <p>19. Health & Safety – where risk and method statements are required then it is the client’s responsibility to provide the Company with contact details and access requirements. If the client wants the Company to carry this out then we reserve the right to charge an administration fee of £60 + VAT.</p>
    <p>20. Cleaning – do not jet wash fabric. There are different strength jet washers and they can damage seams, fade fabric, damage signwriting and cause crinkling of the fabric. Do not use chemicals on the fabric as this can alter the colour and reduce the life of the fabric and damage the signwriting. All Company guarantees are void if the beforehand methods are used.</p>
    <p>21. Delivery – every effort will be made to comply with agreed dates but we do not accept responsibility for failure caused by events outside of our control. You may be liable for extra charges in the event that we attend site and the required services are not in place for the schedule.</p>
    <p>22. Cancellation – can only be accepted if notification is received by the Company in writing. However, if ordering and manufacturing has commenced, cancellation will only be accepted against payment of costs incurred at the date of receipt of such cancellation.</p>
    <p>23. Our name may appear on all our company products.</p>
    <p>24. Errors and omissions exempted from this offer of sale.</p>
    <p>25. Title to all goods will remain the property of the Company until receipt of full payment is made by the client. We reserve the right to reclaim goods that are not paid for within the payment terms previously notified.</p>
    <p>26. We reserve the right to use any photographic images that we may take of your installation in any future publicity materials, unless it is expressly forbidden in writing at the start of the quotation period.</p>
    <p>27. Completion elimination of the strangulation risk can only be achieved by keeping cords, chains and tapes and similar out of the reach of children. Use of additional safety devices may reduce the risk of strangulation but cannot be considered fool proof. Persons in charge of children ultimately responsible for following the safety instructions provided by the manufacturer (BS EN 131209:2009).</p>
<br>
<br>
    <h2>Paint Colour for Plantation Shutters.</h2>
    <p>Saffron Shutters & Awnings will try their best to match the paint colour, however there is a slight margin of variation in the colour due to the nature of the paint, texture of the wood and the lighting used in the room.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
    <p>For all payments we accept HandePay, Credit/Debit Cards, Cash and Cheque.</p>
    <p>Awning– If an installation is only required, the fitting charge of either £350 (3.5m or below) or £400 (4m or above) would be emailed over to you via invoice, <br>
         the fitting fee can be collected on the day of installation or has to be paid within 24 hours after the fitting.

        If Saffron Shutters & Awnings are supplying the awning, the awning/accessories would be required to be 50% paid prior to an order being made.
        
        If it is found you require custom made brackets for your awning, this can be designed, fabricated and powder coated to your requirement <br>
         but payment for the bracket would be required in full. If cancellation of the order was made, no refund would be made.
        
        If a card payment has been made and no order has been placed, a full refund will be made back onto the card that has been paid with.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
    <h2>Delivery Times</h2>
    <p>The lead time for Shutters can be supplied and fitted within 8-10 weeks; this is based on seasonal demand. We cannot be held responsible for any delays or damage in shipping. Unfortunately due to this we are unable to provide discount or compensation due to this being out of our control.

        The lead time for Awnings can be supplied and fitted within 4 weeks, subject to stock availability.</p>
<br>
<br>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>Upon installation of any product/survey done on site, we require somebody with authority (property owner/ manager) to be present to confirm the work being suggested/carried out is to your satisfaction. If no such person is available, it would be assumed that the work carried out would be to your satisfaction.</p>
