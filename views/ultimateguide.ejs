<p>Awnings are especially popular with wide bilfold or patio doors that let a lot of light into the area.</p>
<br>
<!-- WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO MEASURE AN AWNING? -->
<h2>3. What is the best way to measure an awning?</h2>
<br>

<!-- HOW TO CLEAN AN AWNING?-->
<h2>4. How to clean an Awning?</h2>
<br>
<h3>Follow these steps to mantain your canopy fabric:</h3>
<br>

    <p>1.Remove loose dirt with a brush</p>
    <p>2.Apply a cleaning solution of water and mild soap</p>
    <p>3.To clean, use a soft bristle brush</p>
    <p>4.Soak the fabric in the cleaning solution</p>
    <p>5.Make sure all soap residue is removed by throughly rinsing.</p>
    <p>6.Let it air dry</p>
<br>
<!--CAN AWNINGS BE POWER WASHED ?-->
<h2>5. Can awnings be power washed ?</h2>
<br>
<p>We strongly warns against washing your awning with a high-pressure cleaner.</p>
<p>Our recommendation is to use a mild soap or 303 fabric cleaner diluted in warm water.</p>
<br>
<!--CAN AWNINGS BE USED IN A RAIN?-->
<h2>6. Can awnings be used in a rain?</h2>
<br>
<p>Most awnings provide some kind of water protection, yet they aren't considered waterproof because</p>
<p>they can only withstand light rain. If your awning isn't constructed to withstand strong rains, it might be destroyed.</p>
<p>But don't worry, if you currently have an awning that isn't giving appropriate weather protection,</p>
<p>there are many of solutions like weather sensors.</p>
<p>Take a look at the many varietes of awnings on our site <a href="http://www.englishawningsdirect.com/">English Awnings Direct</a>.</p>
<p>We can also advise you on the finest materials for your needs also via our help line or online chat.</p>
<br>
<!--CAN AWNINGS WITHSTAND WIND ?-->
<h2>7. Can awnings withstand wind ?</h2>
<br>
<p>Most self-supported awnings are tested at wind of 20 to 25 miles per hour,</p>
<p>however this assumes a constant wind rather than a buffeting irregular wind, which is significantly more dangerous.</p>
<br>
<!--HOW DO YOU SECURE AWNING FROM STRONG WIND?-->
<h2>8. How do you secure awning from strong wind ?</h2>
<br>
<p>The best solution for strong wind protection is to install one of our wind sensor which automatically extends/retracts</p>
<p>a motorized awning based on wind and sunlight.</p>
<p>If winds are moderate you could consider an awning storm strap which hooks over the awning</p>
<p>and is pegged in at either side to pin the awning down.</p>
<br>
<!--CAN AWNINGS BE USED IN WINTER ?-->
<h2>9. Can awnings be used in winter ?</h2>
<br>
<p>Yes, our awnings can do that ! Retracable awnings provide ourdooor shelter and ultimate protection from winter inclementns.</p>
<p>They are long-lasting and resilient and may be used all year.</p>
<p>Our awnings allow you to keep your awing retracted or extanded all year, allowing you to keep your patio or deck free of snow.</p>
<p>Their sloped roof and solid metal construction are designed to whistand winds and keep snow</p>
<p>from collecting and weighing down on the canvas.</p>
<p>They also come with a waterproof vinyl or acrylic fabric canvas that may be used safely in the winter!</p>
<br>
<!--SNOW-->
<h2>Snow problem</h2>
<br>
<p>Any awning has the potential to be harmed by snow.</p>
<p>Snow may be accumulate swiftly throughout the winter months, from small snow showers to blizzards.</p>
<p>Snow accumulation on your awning may cause rips in the fabric, deform the frame,</p>
<p>and put a lot of strain on your awning in general.</p>
<br>
<!--SUN DAMAGE-->
<h2>Sun damage problem</h2>
<br>
<p>If your fabric has faded due to sun exposure, bursh if off to remove dirt</p>
<p>and then rinse it down with soap to prevent further fading.</p>
<br>
<!--FUNGUS OR MOLD-->
<h2>Fungus or mold problem</h2>
<br>
<p>Due to water and heat exposure, mould might form on your sunshade.</p>
<p>Spray the shade with a hose and use mildew remover to get rid of the fungus.</p>
<p>Make sure the shade isn't closed until it's entirely dry.</p>
<br>
<!--RIPS OR TEARS-->
<h2>Rips or tears problem</h2>
<br>
<p>If your canopy is ripped or damaged, you may replace the holes using patches or special adhesives.</p>
<p>To seal the rip, you can use a waterproof glue, but make sure to clip any threads first.</p>
<br>
<!--BEES AND PESTS-->
<h2>Bees and pests problem</h2>
<br>
<p>Another concern for your awning is bees and pests of any type.</p>
<p>They can build a nest in your reractable awning, causing extensive damage</p>
<p>or providing a safe heven for hazardous special to thrive.</p>
<p>Limiting food supply is the greatest approach to keep bugs away from your awning.</p>
<p>Sugary drinks, food and trash should never be left out in the open.</p>
<p>Use these pointers to keep your outdoor awning in good condition.</p>
<p>Because of the excellent materials and design, you won't have to worry about many of the frequent concerns </p>
<p>when you pruchase an English Awnings Direct retractable awning.</p>
<br>
<br>
                                                                        <!--SENSOR PROBLEM-->
<h2>Sensor problems</h2>
<br>
<h3>Problem:</h3>
<br>
<p>My sensor is broken and my awning won't automatically retract.</p>
<br>
<p>Your awning's sensor is in charge of automatically extending and retracing the awning.</p>
<p>The snsor, like any other electrical component, might fail, preventing the awning from</p>
<p>opening normally.</p>
<br>
<h3>Cause:</h3>
<br>
<p>The sensor may have been destroyed by severe weather, or in the circuitry may have blown out.</p>
<p>During periods of severe rain, if the components or awnings aren't adequately waterproofed, they might be destroyed.</p>
<br>
<h3>Solution:</h3>
<br>
<p>A expert can diagnose the issue with your sensor and determine whether or not it needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>Replacing a sensor is straightforward and does not necessitate tampering with other components.</p>
<p>To eliminate this problem entiely, use an awning with weatherproofed components.</p>
<br>
<br>
<!--MOTOR PROBLEM-->
<h2>Motor problem</h2>
<br>
<h3>Problem:</h3>
<br>
<p>The motor is broken and the awning won't move.</p>
<p>The actual movement of your awning fabric is controlled by the motor.</p>
<p>Your awning will not extend or retract when you push the remote control of the motor is faulty.</p>
<br>
<h3>Cause:</h3>
<br>
<p>The engine may have overheated, or it may have just reached the end of its useful life.</p>
<br>
<h3>Solution:</h3>
<br>
<p>Have the motor inspected by a professional.</p>
<p>They'll be able to tell if the motor needs to be repaired or if it has to be replaced totally.</p>
<br>
<!--AWNING WILL NOT EXTEND-->
<h2>Awning will not extend problem</h2>
<br>
<p>Awnings that are stuck have two basic issues: they either don't extend or don't retract.</p>
<p>You won't be able to receive and shade if your awning doesn't stretch. Isn't it a hassle ?</p>
<p>Check to see whether your awning has been recalled before you start prying around.</p>
<br>
<!-- FIVE ADVICES FOR TROUBLESHOOTING-->
<h3 class="advantages">Check our five advices for troubleshooting:</h3>
<br>
    <p>1.First, look for tripped circuit breakers and blown fuses.</p>
    <p>If you don't hear any motor operation at all, all the awning's fuse might be blown.</p>
    <p>Examine the electrical components in your RV's motor whether the fuse is stable.</p>
    <p>2.In and around your awning's motor, look for any obvious rusted wire.</p>
    <p>If the electrical current that powers your motor isn't transported efficiently, it won't operate.</p>
    <p>Are there any wires that are frayed or corroded ? If this is the case, your awning's problem might be due faulty wiring.</p>
    <p>3.Check to verify whether the awning is loaded incorrectly.</p>
    <p>Awnings that aren't uniformly coiled into their tubes won't be able to fully stretch.</p>
    <p>As a result, the awning becomes stuck.</p>
    <p>4.To operate the awning motor, press the awning motor button.</p>
    <p>Get a buddy to manually roll out the awning from the tube while you hold the extension button if </p>
    <p>your motor is functioning but not retracing. Rain can damage the awning's components,</p>
    <p>making it harder for the motor to operate to its full potential.</p>
    <p>Often, a complete pull is enough to loosen the rust.</p>
    <p>5.If you hear a faint click while the motor is operating, it might be a stripped screw or a motor problem.</p>
    <p>Because it involves changing critical motor parts while a high degree of competence and accuracy,</p>
    <p>this need professional assistance.</p>
<br>
<!--TRACKS-->
<h2>Track problem</h2>
<br>
<h3>Awning will not retract problem</h3>
<h3>Check what to do !</h3>
<br>
<p>1.Examine the awning to verify if it is correctly positioned on the rail.</p>
<p>Awnings, both manual and electric, have trouble retracing if they aren't uniformly spaced on the rail.</p>
<p>Is the fabric stretched evenly and parallel by the awning arms?</p>
<p>If this is not the case, you may need to contact a service company or physically relocate the awning.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>2.Check the awning cordes for screws. Are you able to adjust the chords of the awning?</p>
<p>If that's the case, it's not a good indicator. This indicates that the screws on your</p>
<p>cords are loose, which may be interfering with your awning.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>3.Move the arms of the awning. If the arms of your awning aren't moving parallel to one other and smoothly,</p>
<p>it's possible that you require awning arm repair. If they're simpply rusted, some WD-40 will help. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>4.Take a look at the material. If you left your awning open during a particularly severe downpour,</p>
<p>the water and debris accumulation might have twisted the fabric.</p>
<p>The only way to correct warped fabric is to replace it on your awning.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>5.Check the fuses, wiring, and circuit breakers on your awning.</p>
<p>Electrical faults can cause an awning to be unable to retract, just as an awning that won't stretch.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>6.If your motor continues to run but no improvement is apparent, get it checked by a specialist.</p>
<p>It might be a faulty component in your motor, or it could be something completely else. This is, however, quite exceptional.</p>
<br>
<br>
<!--FABRIC PROBLEM-->
<h2>Fabric problem</h2>
<br>
<h3>Problem:</h3>
<br>
<p>The awning fabric is torn or mouldy.</p>
<br>
<h3>Cause:</h3>
<br>
<p>Fabrics that aren't properly weatherproofed might be damaged, spawn mould, or even decompose </p>
<p>after prolonged exposure to the elements.</p>
<br>
<h3>Solution:</h3>
<br>
<p>Awning fabric that has become mouldy or rotted must be replaced.</p>
<p>A expert might be able to repair tiny damages without having to replace the entire fabric.</p>
<p>If you do decide to replace the fabric, make sure it has a waterproog covering.</p>
<p>Also, don't settle for low-quality fabric.</p>
<p>Fabrics of higher quality are more resistant to damage and will save you money in long term.</p>
<p>Please choose your colour of interest and write a query to us so we can send you a free sample</p>
<p>as well as sell fabric only according to your specific measurement.</p>
<br>
<!--DROP ARM AWNINGS-->
<h2>Drop arm awnings problem</h2>
<br>
<p>It's the most common style of retractable window awning </p>
<p>it's perfect for swiftly erecting a cover over a small outdoor areas.</p>
<p>These canopies are ideal for when you need to use outdoor spaces but don't want to be exposed to the weather.</p>
<p>The difficulty with most drop arm awnings is that hinges degrade quickly if not properly maintained.</p>
<p>To guarantee optimal performance when retracing, you should inspect and libricate (oil)</p>
<p>the hinges at least once every few months.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you'll end up with a static considerably more expensive that it has to be.</p>
<br>
<!--AGE-->
<h2>Age problem</h2>
<br>
<p>Our awnings are made of good quality, both manual and retractable, are made to last, but time will wear them down.</p>
<p>While good awning maintenance can keep its appearance and funcionality, age-related difficulties can and will arise.</p>
<br>
<h3>The problem:</h3>
<br>
<p>Age-related problems can't be avoided. Electricity may play a role in some age-related issues.</p>
<p>The issue might be due to awning's construction, implying that the tracks have reached their maximum.</p>
<p>One of the most prevalent age-related difficulties is aesthetic concerns.</p>
<p>An awning with rusted components and fading bafric may be functional, but it will detract from the curb appeal of your property.</p>
<br>
<h3>The solution:</h3>
<br>
<p>Any significant concerns with an awning should be handled by specialists if you're wondering how to reapir an awning.</p>
